# Business-card
This module makes it easy to create business cards.I have created one class for this module.And when you use that class, you have to put your name, phone number, and email by default.For example, card = Card (daniel, 010-1234-5678, hello@naver.com).This class has three methods.It has info(),edit_info(name,phone,E - mail),write_info(flie name,where do you want to save).Info method can print Business-card.Edit_info method can edit info.write_info method can save business cards as txt files
